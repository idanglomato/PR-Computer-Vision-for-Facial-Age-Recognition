# Practicum Data Science Project
## Computer Vision for Facial Age Recognition

### Description
A supermarket franchise named Good Seed wants to determine if Data Science can help them comply with the law by ensuring that they do not sell age-restricted products to underage customers. You are tasked to carry out the evaluation. Therefore, as you begin your work, keep the following in mind: The franchise stores are equipped with cameras at the cashier area that will display a signal when someone purchases an age-restricted product. Computer vision methods can be used to determine a person's age from a photo. Your task is to build and evaluate a model to verify a person's age. To start working on this task, you will be given a set of photos of people with their corresponding age labels.

### Objectives
Build and evaluate a computer vision model to determine a person's age from a photo.
